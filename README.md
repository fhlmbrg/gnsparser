<b>How it works:</b><br>
Copy the files to a webserver and open up http://<hostname>/index.php<br>
<br>
Build your Dynagen/GNS3 topology then drag and drop your .net file on to the field on the webpage. The topology is run through a series of scripts and in return you will receive a ZIP file containing the router configs. All interfaces including a routing protocol has been pre-configured allowing you to focus on a specific routing scenario or feature instead of the initial lab setup.
<br>
<b>Requirements:</b><br>
- Write access to the folder named "files".<br>
- Current version support router nodes with point-to-point connections.<br>
- Use default hostnames (R1, R5, R10 ..). If you need a custom naming scheme apply it afterwards.<br>
